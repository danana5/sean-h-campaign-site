              I've learned so much and I have gained many unique experiences but I've also been fortunate enough to meet many great people and characters whom I am lucky to 
              call friends.<br><br>I am a front-end developer but with a strong interest also with full stack development. I have experience using React.js and Vue.js 
              aswell as Python, Java and C.<br><br>Anyways, I played semi-proffesional football for Drogheda United in the League of Ireland. I am obsessed with music and several 
              artists such as; Flume, deadmau5, 
              Porter Robinson and Brockhampton. Film-wise, I love Christopher Nolan and nearly all of his films, I like Tarantino also and I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve.
